fix(security): remove client-side access leak in TalentProfileClient (PR3 hardening)

Fix critical security leak where TalentProfileClient component was computing
access client-side, bypassing server-side relationship checks.

Changes:
- Changed prop type from full TalentProfile to TalentPublicClientModel (safe public shape + optional phone)
- Removed client-side access logic (user.role === 'client' check)
- Render based on server-determined phone presence only (if phone exists, show it; else show locked)
- Updated locked copy text to match Option B policy (relationship-bound, not blanket client access)

This ensures Option B is enforced end-to-end: server determines access,
client only renders what server sends.

Documentation:
- Updated PR3 summary: docs/PR3_SUMMARY.md
- Updated common errors reference: docs/COMMON_ERRORS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

Risk: Low (Client component fix, no server changes)
RED ZONE INVOLVED: NO
