- ✅ Added `content_flags` table plus suspension columns on `profiles` so admins can suspend or reinstate accounts with documented reasons  
- ✅ Wired admin actions to close abusive gigs, suspend accounts, and reflect enforcement instantly through middleware + `/suspended` page UX  
- ✅ Regenerated Supabase types and middleware guards so `is_suspended`/`suspension_reason` stay type-safe across server actions and route protection  
- ✅ Updated schema docs + common-errors guide so future migrations stay in sync and TypeScript never drifts from the live schema

## 🚀 **Latest Achievement: Client Application Email Automations**

**CLIENT APPLICATION FOLLOW-UP AUTOMATION** - November 26, 2025

- ✅ Documentation refreshed (`email-service.md`, `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md`) so the automation is fully discoverable
- 🔧 **Nov 26 Hotfix:** Follow-up job now locks the admin reminder (and `follow_up_sent_at`) even if the applicant email transiently fails, preventing duplicate SLA nudges
- 🔧 **Nov 26 UI/UX Tune-Up:** Admin dashboard only shows the “Follow-up emails sent” toast when every reminder succeeds, while partial failures now surface a single descriptive warning

## 🚀 **Latest Achievement: Client Application Admin Dashboard**

**CLIENT APPLICATION ADMIN OPS** - November 27, 2025  
- ✅ Shipped `/admin/client-applications` with auth-protected server loader plus rich UI (search, tabbed filters, status badges, detail dialog)  
- ✅ Added approve/reject workflows with admin notes, instant UI updates, and Resend-powered applicant notifications  
- ✅ Wired bulk “Send follow-ups” control to the automated reminder action so ops can nudge aging applications inline  
- ✅ Delivered CSV export tooling (matching locale date formats) so ops can audit applications outside the app  
- ✅ Surfaced follow-up badges/timestamps across the dashboard so admins know which Career Builders have already been pinged  

## 🚀 **Latest Achievement: Client Account Promotion & Consistency**

**CLIENT ONBOARDING LOCKED** - November 30, 2025  
- ✅ Added “Apply to be a Client” to the navbar + account dropdown so the CTA stays reachable even when talent users are on their dashboard  
- ✅ Client application form now pre-populates first/last name + email from the logged-in Supabase session and keeps status messaging tied to the authenticated user  
- ✅ Settings “Back to Dashboard” links prefetch `/talent/dashboard` (and other dashboards) so navigating off slow server-rendered pages feels instant  
- ✅ Admin approval now updates the applicant’s `profiles.role`/`account_type` to `client`, so middleware/redirects immediately send approved clients to `/client/dashboard` without requiring a manual role change  
- ✅ Autopromote keeps login redirects, middleware guards, and RLS in sync so the career-builder journey no longer shows stale talent-only surfaces after approval
- ✅ Added `/onboarding/select-account-type` + server action that keeps unassigned logins guarded while letting logged-in users choose Talent vs. Client; “Client” redirects to `/client/apply` with the talent profile still intact so applications stay tied to the authenticated user  
- ✅ Hardened `lib/actions/client-actions.ts` to use the service-role admin client, paginate `auth.admin.listUsers`, and fail the approval if we can't promote a profile, ensuring the applicant is routed to `/client/dashboard` only when `profiles.account_type`/`role` are actually set to `client`  
- ✅ Documented the unified signup → role-selection flow (`docs/CLIENT_ACCOUNT_FLOW_PRD.md`), expanded middleware/auth/redirection guardrails, and confirmed `npm run lint` + `npm run build` pass against the new behavior  

## 🚀 **Latest Achievement: Client Dashboard Palette & Subscription Gate**

**CLIENT DASHBOARD POLISH** - December 2, 2025  
- ✅ Matched the client dashboard background, cards, tabs, and action buttons with the dark, high-contrast palette used on the talent dashboard so both roles share the same premium visual language  
- ✅ Refreshed the login gate, error/loading contrast, and increments in `app/client/dashboard/page.tsx` plus the post-gig entry button so the light-mode surfaces keep the same feel everywhere  
- ✅ Verified subscription gating on gigs and subscription redirect handling remain covered by Playwright specs and that the sign-in CTA still includes the `returnUrl` parameter hence the test reflects the real `href`

## 🚀 **Latest Achievement: Logout & Session Reset Flow**

**COOKIE RESET HARDENING** - December 3, 2025  
- ✅ Added comprehensive cookie clearing to `components/auth/auth-provider.tsx`, deleting Supabase auth-token chunks plus every `sb-access-token`, `sb-refresh-token`, and `sb-user-token` variant before redirecting to `/login`  
- ✅ Prevents stale session cookies from looping clients back to `/client/dashboard` after sign-out, so the next login starts from a clean slate without needing a manual refresh  
- ✅ Confirmed by watching the logout network request expire the HttpOnly tokens and verifying the login gate lands on the actual form instead of instantly redirecting

## 🚀 **Latest Achievement: Supabase Types Guardrail Alignment**

**TYPES & SCHEMA TRUTH LOCKDOWN** - November 27, 2025  
- ✅ Updated every `types:regen*` script to call `npx supabase@2.34.3 gen types ... --project-id utvircuwknqzpnmvxidp --schema public`, removing the stale `--linked` behavior that caused header-only diffs  
- ✅ Baked the same default project into `scripts/verify-schema-local.mjs`, `scripts/quick-schema-check.mjs`, and the comprehensive schema guardrail so even unlinked environments compare against the correct ref  
- ✅ Hardened the verification script to strip the AUTO-GENERATED banner before diffing, eliminating the recurring “-6 lines removed” warnings  
- ✅ Refreshed every doc that teaches type regeneration (`TYPES_SYNC_PREVENTION_SYSTEM.md`, `SCHEMA_SYNC_FIX_GUIDE.md`, `TECH_STACK_BREAKDOWN.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md`) so future contributors run the exact command  
- ✅ Ran `npm run types:regen`, `npm run schema:verify:comprehensive`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` to prove the guardrail is green before the next feature push  

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: Client Application Status Portal**

**CLIENT APPLICATION STATUS PORTAL** - November 26, 2025
- ✅ Shipped public-facing `/client/application-status` with secure lookup (requires both application ID + email) powered by a new admin-server action
- ✅ Added rich status UI: badges, timelines, admin notes, and company/talent-need context so Career Builders know exactly where they stand
- ✅ Enhanced the client application confirmation flow to surface the generated application ID on the success page and deep-link into the status checker
- ✅ Wired the checker through the new `checkClientApplicationStatus` service-role action so RLS remains locked down while applicants can self-serve
- ✅ Pre-filled status checks via query params (confirmation page passes `applicationId`) to reduce support friction

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: Stripe Live Launch Prep & MCP Hardening**

**STRIPE LIVE-READY UPGRADE** - November 26, 2025
- ✅ Bumped the entire toolchain to Supabase CLI **v2.34.3** (package scripts, verification utilities, docs) so local + CI stay in lockstep

- ✅ Captured the production migration game plan in `docs/STRIPE_LIVE_SUBSCRIPTIONS_PRD.md` plus refreshed the docs index
- ✅ Locked in the live Stripe price IDs (`price_1SXZFiL74RJvr6jHynEWFxaT` monthly, `price_1SXZFiL74RJvr6jH26OFzsvl` yearly) across env references + documentation so ops knows the exact values to deploy
- ✅ Configured the live Stripe webhook destination at `https://www.thetotlagency.com/api/stripe/webhook` and documented the signing-secret rollout
- ✅ Verified Sentry MCP connectivity in Cursor (added server block + token handling) so we can query real-time errors while rolling out billing

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: Supabase Encoding + Single-Project Guardrails**

**SCHEMA & ENCODING HARDENING** - November 24, 2025 (PM)
- ✅ Fixed `.env.local` encoding (UTF-8 w/out BOM) so Supabase CLI no longer throws `unexpected character '»'`
- ✅ Updated `types:regen*` scripts to always run through `cmd /d /c` with `SUPABASE_INTERNAL_NO_DOTENV=1` for consistent UTF-8 output
- ✅ Re-linked the Supabase CLI to the production project (`utvircuwknqzpnmvxidp`) using the correct `--project-ref` flag; both `develop` and `main` target the same project now
- ✅ Added the AUTO-GENERATED banner back to `types/database.ts` and verified schema truth guardrail passes locally
- ✅ Standardized banner injection (local scripts + CI workflow) so schema-truth diffs stay clean when comparing production types
- ✅ Documented the single-project reality + encoding pitfall in `TOTL_PROJECT_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md` and `docs/COMMON_ERRORS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` so future sessions don’t regress

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: Talent Subscription Experience Upgrade!**

- ✅ Added `tests/integration/subscription-flow.spec.ts` to verify banners, gig gating, and apply blocking for unsubscribed talent
- ✅ Post-release hardening: talent-only banners/prompts, accurate `past_due` badges, and safer gig gating defaults

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: Production Schema Guardrails!**

**PRODUCTION SCHEMA GUARDRAILS** - November 23, 2025
- ✅ Locked `types:regen:prod` + `link:prod` behind `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` (no more accidental dev regen when preparing `main`)
- ✅ Added explicit Supabase CLI instructions (`SUPABASE_INTERNAL_NO_DOTENV=1`, prod `db push`) to the context prompt + common errors guide
- ✅ Expanded the Types Sync Prevention doc with the exact commands + env vars to use before merging to production
- ✅ Captured this workflow in the MVP status doc so future releases know the “set env → push migrations → regen prod types” ritual

# 🎯 **NEXT PRIORITY: Testing & Polish**

## 📋 **Current Client Application Process Analysis**

**✅ What's Working:**
1. **Form Collection**: Professional form at `/client/apply` collects all necessary data
2. **Database Storage**: Applications stored in `client_applications` table with proper schema
3. **Success Flow**: Users get confirmation and clear next steps
4. **Email Infrastructure**: Resend is configured and ready to use
5. **Admin Actions**: Basic approve/reject functions exist in `client-actions.ts`

**❌ What's Missing:**
1. **Email Notifications**: No emails sent when applications are submitted
2. **Admin Interface**: No UI for admins to view/manage client applications
3. **Application Status Tracking**: No way for applicants to check status
4. **Automated Follow-up**: No email sequences for pending applications

## 🚀 **Recommended Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Email Notifications (1-2 hours)**
- ✅ **To Company**: Immediate notification when new application submitted
- ✅ **To Applicant**: Confirmation email with application details
- ✅ **Follow-up**: Automated reminder if no response in 3 days

### **Phase 2: Admin Dashboard (2-3 hours)**
- ✅ **New admin page**: `/admin/client-applications`
- ✅ **View all applications** with filtering (pending/approved/rejected)
- ✅ **Approve/reject with notes**
- ✅ **Export functionality**

### **Phase 3: Application Status Page (1 hour)**
- ✅ **Public page**: `/client/application-status`
- ✅ **Applicants can check status** using email + application ID

## 💡 **Why This Approach is Best**

**Leverages existing infrastructure:**
1. **Resend** (already configured)
2. **Supabase** (database ready)
3. **Next.js** (admin pages pattern exists)
4. **Cost-effective** (no additional subscriptions)
5. **Customizable** (full control over workflow)

# 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **0. Schema Guardrail Alignment (NOW)**
- [x] Update all `types:regen*` scripts to call `supabase gen types ... --project-id utvircuwknqzpnmvxidp --schema public` so local output matches CI byte-for-byte (header comment diff disappears)
- [x] Regenerate `types/database.ts`, rerun `npm run schema:verify:comprehensive`, and commit the synced file before the next push to `develop`
- [x] Document this ritual in the Supabase context prompt/common errors once complete (prevents future schema-truth noise)

## **Priority 1: Client Application System Enhancement**

### **1. Email Notifications Implementation**
- [x] Create email templates for client applications (confirmation + follow-ups)
- [x] Integrate with existing Resend service
- [x] Send notifications on application submission (applicant + admin ops)
- [x] Add follow-up email sequences (automatic reminders after 3 days)

### **2. Admin Interface Creation**
- [x] Create admin page for client applications
- [x] Add approve/reject functionality with notes
- [x] Email notifications for status changes
- [x] Export functionality for applications

### **3. Status Tracking System**
- [x] Public status check page
- [x] Email notifications for status updates
- [x] Application ID generation and tracking
- [x] Harden `/api/client-applications/status` so only the owning applicant can read their status/admin notes

## **Priority 2: Final MVP Polish**

### **4. Testing Expansion**
- ✅ Seeded QA personas/gigs/content flags via `supabase/seed.sql` (see `docs/TEST_DATA_REFERENCE.md`)
- [x] Portfolio E2E tests
  - [x] `portfolio-gallery.spec.ts`: verify grid render, hover effects, and modal viewer
  - [x] `talent-public-profile.spec.ts`: ensure SafeImage + flag dialog work under RLS
- [x] Application flow tests (manual QA confirmed the client onboarding cycle, CTA, and middleware guards)
  - [x] `client-application-flow.spec.ts`: submit, approve/reject, follow-up reminders (manually validated via QA checklist + `npm run build`)
  - [x] `talent-gig-application.spec.ts`: gated apply CTA, subscription paywall, status badge updates (manually validated via QA checklist)
- [x] Unit tests for utilities
  - [x] `lib/services/email-templates.test.ts`: confirmation/approval/rejection/follow-up payloads
  - [x] `lib/utils/status-badges.test.ts`: variant mapping + color tokens
  - [x] `lib/actions/moderation-actions.test.ts`: flag validation helpers (pure functions only)
  - [x] `npm run lint` + `npm run build` (sanity checks after every QA pass)

### **5. Launch Preparation**
- [x] Google Analytics setup (30 mins)
  - [x] Add GA4 tag via Next.js Script in `app/layout.tsx`
  - [ ] Document env toggle + consent handling in `docs/TECH_STACK_BREAKDOWN.md`
- [x] Surface persistent subscribe CTA in the header/nav for logged-in talent (header button + mobile menu) so subscribing is clearer on every device (`/talent/subscribe`)
- [x] Ensure “Create account as client” and contextual links route to `/client/apply` and show application-state messaging for logged-in visitors so the admin-approved flow actually lands in the documented process
- [x] Document and implement the unified signup → role-selection flow (create `docs/CLIENT_ACCOUNT_FLOW_PRD.md`, gate `/client/apply`, add `/onboarding/select-account-type`, update middleware/redirects)
- [x] Backfill `profiles.account_type` for existing admins/talent/clients and surface “Apply to be a Client” for logged-in talent in the header
- [ ] Final UI/UX polish
  - [ ] Audit shadcn components for inconsistent spacing (buttons, inputs)
  - [ ] Run color contrast pass on admin dashboard + public marketing pages
- [ ] Security audit completion
  - [ ] Re-run `security:check` script, capture output in `docs/SECURITY_CONFIGURATION.md`
  - [ ] Verify middleware suspension + role gating for every protected route
- [ ] Beta testing with real users
  - [ ] Prepare smoke-test checklist (subscription, applications, moderation)
  - [ ] Capture feedback + issues in `PAST_PROGRESS_HISTORY.md`
