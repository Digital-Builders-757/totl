# 🎉 CURRENT STATUS: MVP COMPLETE WITH SUBSCRIPTION SYSTEM!

## 🚀 **Latest Achievement: Client Application Status Portal**

**CLIENT APPLICATION STATUS PORTAL** - November 26, 2025
- ✅ Shipped public-facing `/client/application-status` with secure lookup (requires both application ID + email) powered by a new admin-server action
- ✅ Added rich status UI: badges, timelines, admin notes, and company/talent-need context so Career Builders know exactly where they stand
- ✅ Enhanced the client application confirmation flow to surface the generated application ID on the success page and deep-link into the status checker
- ✅ Wired the checker through the new `checkClientApplicationStatus` service-role action so RLS remains locked down while applicants can self-serve
- ✅ Pre-filled status checks via query params (confirmation page passes `applicationId`) to reduce support friction

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: Stripe Live Launch Prep & MCP Hardening**

**STRIPE LIVE-READY UPGRADE** - November 26, 2025
- ✅ Bumped the entire toolchain to Supabase CLI **v2.34.3** (package scripts, verification utilities, docs) so local + CI stay in lockstep
- ✅ Regenerated schema types, re-linked CLI to `utvircuwknqzpnmvxidp`, and re-ran schema/lint/build checks to keep `develop` green
- ✅ Captured the production migration game plan in `docs/STRIPE_LIVE_SUBSCRIPTIONS_PRD.md` plus refreshed the docs index
- ✅ Locked in the live Stripe price IDs (`price_1SXZFiL74RJvr6jHynEWFxaT` monthly, `price_1SXZFiL74RJvr6jH26OFzsvl` yearly) across env references + documentation so ops knows the exact values to deploy
- ✅ Configured the live Stripe webhook destination at `https://www.thetotlagency.com/api/stripe/webhook` and documented the signing-secret rollout
- ✅ Verified Sentry MCP connectivity in Cursor (added server block + token handling) so we can query real-time errors while rolling out billing

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: Supabase Encoding + Single-Project Guardrails**

**SCHEMA & ENCODING HARDENING** - November 24, 2025 (PM)
- ✅ Fixed `.env.local` encoding (UTF-8 w/out BOM) so Supabase CLI no longer throws `unexpected character '»'`
- ✅ Updated `types:regen*` scripts to always run through `cmd /d /c` with `SUPABASE_INTERNAL_NO_DOTENV=1` for consistent UTF-8 output
- ✅ Re-linked the Supabase CLI to the production project (`utvircuwknqzpnmvxidp`) using the correct `--project-ref` flag; both `develop` and `main` target the same project now
- ✅ Added the AUTO-GENERATED banner back to `types/database.ts` and verified schema truth guardrail passes locally
- ✅ Standardized banner injection (local scripts + CI workflow) so schema-truth diffs stay clean when comparing production types
- ✅ Documented the single-project reality + encoding pitfall in `TOTL_PROJECT_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md` and `docs/COMMON_ERRORS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` so future sessions don’t regress

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: Talent Subscription Experience Upgrade!**

**TALENT SUBSCRIPTION UX + ENFORCEMENT** - November 24, 2025
- ✅ Added a dedicated “Subscription” entry (with live status pill) in the talent navigation so the upgrade path is always visible
- ✅ Banner + inline prompts now show on the dashboard, gigs list, gig details, and apply flows whenever a talent account is not active
- ✅ Gig cards/titles/descriptions now obfuscate client intel for free users while active subscribers still see full data
- ✅ Apply/Client-detail sections enforce gating with branded CTAs that jump straight to `/talent/subscribe`
- ✅ Auth context now keeps subscription status/plan/current period end in memory so the UI can react instantly post-webhook
- ✅ Added `tests/integration/subscription-flow.spec.ts` to verify banners, gig gating, and apply blocking for unsubscribed talent
- ✅ Post-release hardening: talent-only banners/prompts, accurate `past_due` badges, and safer gig gating defaults

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: Production Schema Guardrails!**

**PRODUCTION SCHEMA GUARDRAILS** - November 23, 2025
- ✅ Locked `types:regen:prod` + `link:prod` behind `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` (no more accidental dev regen when preparing `main`)
- ✅ Added explicit Supabase CLI instructions (`SUPABASE_INTERNAL_NO_DOTENV=1`, prod `db push`) to the context prompt + common errors guide
- ✅ Expanded the Types Sync Prevention doc with the exact commands + env vars to use before merging to production
- ✅ Captured this workflow in the MVP status doc so future releases know the “set env → push migrations → regen prod types” ritual

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: UI/UX Playwright Stability Fix!**

**UI/UX PLAYWRIGHT TEST STABILITY** - November 23, 2025
- ✅ Replaced deprecated `page.emulate` usage with a typed Playwright mobile context
- ✅ Ensures hover disablement test correctly simulates touch hardware without TS errors
- ✅ Keeps reduced-hover media query validation intact across browsers
- ✅ `npm run build` + full Playwright suite now pass without blocking type issues
- ✅ Documentation + status audit updated to reflect the stabilization work

## 🚀 **Previous Achievement: Stripe Stability & Subscription Hardening!**

**STRIPE STABILITY & ERROR-HANDLING HARDENING** - November 23, 2025
- ✅ Enforced env validation for both `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- ✅ Standardized Stripe API versioning (uses official `2024-06-20` release string and documents the rule)
- ✅ Webhook now reads `current_period_end` from subscription items (forward-compatible with latest API)
- ✅ Billing portal session checks mirror checkout safeguards (no redirect to `undefined`)
- ✅ Subscribe & billing pages no longer ignore Supabase errors; follow `.maybeSingle()` best practice
- ✅ Subscription prompts now have accurate messaging even if helpers are reused
- ✅ Added `docs/STRIPE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` plus new entries in `COMMON_ERRORS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- ✅ Full `npm run build` regression passing after every fix

---

# 🎯 **NEXT PRIORITY: Testing & Polish**

## 📋 **Current Client Application Process Analysis**

**✅ What's Working:**
1. **Form Collection**: Professional form at `/client/apply` collects all necessary data
2. **Database Storage**: Applications stored in `client_applications` table with proper schema
3. **Success Flow**: Users get confirmation and clear next steps
4. **Email Infrastructure**: Resend is configured and ready to use
5. **Admin Actions**: Basic approve/reject functions exist in `client-actions.ts`

**❌ What's Missing:**
1. **Email Notifications**: No emails sent when applications are submitted
2. **Admin Interface**: No UI for admins to view/manage client applications
3. **Application Status Tracking**: No way for applicants to check status
4. **Automated Follow-up**: No email sequences for pending applications

## 🚀 **Recommended Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Email Notifications (1-2 hours)**
- ✅ **To Company**: Immediate notification when new application submitted
- ✅ **To Applicant**: Confirmation email with application details
- ✅ **Follow-up**: Automated reminder if no response in 3 days

### **Phase 2: Admin Dashboard (2-3 hours)**
- ✅ **New admin page**: `/admin/client-applications`
- ✅ **View all applications** with filtering (pending/approved/rejected)
- ✅ **Approve/reject with notes**
- ✅ **Export functionality**

### **Phase 3: Application Status Page (1 hour)**
- ✅ **Public page**: `/client/application-status`
- ✅ **Applicants can check status** using email + application ID

## 💡 **Why This Approach is Best**

**Leverages existing infrastructure:**
1. **Resend** (already configured)
2. **Supabase** (database ready)
3. **Next.js** (admin pages pattern exists)
4. **Cost-effective** (no additional subscriptions)
5. **Customizable** (full control over workflow)
