# 🧱 totl MVP - Updated Status

> **What is Totl Agency?**
> 
> It's a web platform that helps **talent (like models or creatives)** get discovered and **book gigs** with **clients (like brands or casting agents)**. Think of it like [Backstage.com](http://backstage.com/), but cleaner, faster, and more tailored for today's user experience.

# ✅ What's Done

> This is everything that's already built or fully functional.

## 🔐 Authentication

- [x]  **Email/password login**: Users can sign up and log in securely.
- [x]  **Role-based signup**: Talent and clients get different account types and dashboards.
- [x]  **Email verification flow**: We've started adding a "click the link in your email to verify" feature for extra security.
- [x]  **Admin account system**: Admin accounts can be created and managed for platform administration.

## 💻 Frontend

- [x]  **Next.js App Router**: Our frontend is built using a modern, scalable routing system from Next.js 15.

- [x]  **Enums**: Enums define valid values for roles and status (e.g. `gig_status = active`, `booking_status = confirmed`).
- [x]  **Triggers**: When someone signs up, we automatically create their profile and role data behind the scenes.
- [x]  **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Keeps data safe—users can only see or modify their own stuff.
- [x]  **Type generation**: Automated TypeScript type generation from database schema.

## 🎬 Gig Management

- [x]  **Gig creation system**: Admin users can create gigs through a comprehensive form interface.
- [x]  **Gig detail pages**: Individual gig pages display all relevant information for talent.
- [x]  **Gig status management**: Active gigs are properly displayed and filtered.
- [x]  **Application submission**: Talent can now successfully submit applications to gigs.
- [x]  **Profile validation**: System checks for complete talent profiles before allowing applications.

## 📱 User Experience Improvements

- [x]  **Error handling**: Comprehensive error tracking with Sentry integration.
- [x]  **Hydration fixes**: Resolved React hydration mismatch errors from browser extensions.
- [x]  **Image handling**: SafeImage component properly handles null/empty image URLs.

- [x]  **Loading states**: Proper Suspense boundaries for async components.

## 🚀 DevOps

- [x]  **GitHub Setup**: Version control is live with protected branches (for code review).
- [x]  **Vercel Deployment**: App is hosted on Vercel with auto-preview links for every pull request.
- [x]  **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment with TypeScript checking.
- [x]  **Documentation**: There's a full README and coding style guide to keep things clean for all devs.
- [x]  **Supabase MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol integration for enhanced development workflow.
