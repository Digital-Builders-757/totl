## Airport Maintenance Report Table

| Surface Name | File Path(s) | Current Behavior | Expected Behavior | Severity | Recommendation | Proof Hook |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Talent Directory Page** | `app/talent/page.tsx` (lines 67-123) | Page exists and renders "Browse our curated collection" header. Middleware redirects SO/T/C away, but page still exists. | Page should not exist OR should be admin-only with different copy. | P1 | Remove page entirely OR convert to admin-only roster view with "Admin Talent Roster" copy. | `middleware.ts:86` redirects SO, but page still accessible to admins |
| **Choose Role Page Copy** | `app/choose-role/page.tsx` (lines 145, 155) | Client signup flow says "browse our talent roster" and "Browse our curated talent roster". | Remove "browse roster" language per Approach B. | P2 | Replace with "Connect with talent" or "Find the perfect talent for your projects". | Copy only, no functional violation |
| **Homepage Featured Talent Copy** | `app/page.tsx` (line 226) | Section header says "Browse our curated selection of verified talent". | Remove "Browse" language per Approach B. | P2 | Replace with "Discover Verified Talent" or "Featured Talent". | Copy only, no functional violation |

| **Gigs Page "Find Gigs"** | `app/gigs/page.tsx` (lines 221, 229, 232) | Page says "Find Gigs" and "Browse through available casting opportunities". Page is behind sign-in gate per G1. | ✅ COMPLIANT — Signed-in users can browse gigs per G1. | ✅ | No change needed. | `middleware.ts:91` requires sign-in for `/gigs` |
| **Navbar Gigs Link** | `components/navbar.tsx` (lines 292-299) | Shows "Gigs" link only for signed-in users. | ✅ COMPLIANT — Per G1, gigs list requires sign-in. | ✅ | No change needed. | `navbar.tsx:292` conditional `{user && ...}` |
| **Command Palette** | `components/command-palette.tsx` (lines 54-72) | Shows "Browse Gigs" for signed-in, "Sign in to Browse Gigs" for signed-out. | ✅ COMPLIANT — Per G1, correct messaging. | ✅ | No change needed. | `command-palette.tsx:54` conditional based on `user` |

## Top 10 Quick Wins (Post PR1-3)

### P1 Issues (Functional/UX)

1. **Remove or Convert `/talent` Directory Page** (`app/talent/page.tsx`)
   - **Impact:** Page still exists, violates Approach B (no talent directory)
   - **Effort:** Low (delete file OR convert to admin-only)
   - **Recommendation:** Delete entirely (admin can use `/admin/talent` if needed)

### P2 Issues (Copy/Text Only)

2. **Fix Choose Role Page Copy** (`app/choose-role/page.tsx`)
   - **Impact:** Copy implies "browse roster" which violates Approach B
   - **Effort:** Very Low (text replacement)
   - **Recommendation:** Replace "browse our talent roster" → "connect with talent"

3. **Fix Homepage Featured Talent Copy** (`app/page.tsx`)
   - **Impact:** Copy says "Browse" which implies directory behavior
   - **Effort:** Very Low (text replacement)
   - **Recommendation:** Replace "Browse our curated selection" → "Discover Verified Talent"

### Already Compliant (No Action Needed)

4-10. All other surfaces verified compliant ✅

## PR Sequence Plan (Post PR1-3 Cleanup)

### PR4: Query Strategy Cleanup (Already Planned)
**Goal:** Remove enumeration patterns, implement slug-based lookup
- **Status:** Planned (not started)
- **Scope:** `app/talent/[slug]/page.tsx` - replace "fetch all then filter" with slug lookup

### PR5: Final Copy/Text Cleanup (New)
**Goal:** Fix remaining P2 copy violations

**Changes:**
1. **Delete `/talent` directory page** (`app/talent/page.tsx`)
   - OR convert to admin-only with different copy
   - **Recommendation:** Delete (admin can use `/admin/talent`)

2. **Fix Choose Role copy** (`app/choose-role/page.tsx`)
   - Replace "browse our talent roster" → "connect with talent"
   - Replace "Browse our curated talent roster" → "Find the perfect talent for your projects"

3. **Fix Homepage Featured Talent copy** (`app/page.tsx`)
   - Replace "Browse our curated selection" → "Discover Verified Talent"

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ No "browse roster" or "browse talent" language anywhere
- ✅ `/talent` directory page removed or admin-only
- ✅ All copy aligns with Approach B policy (no directory implications)

**Risk:** Low (copy changes only, no functional changes)
