# Release Notes — v1.1.0 (UX Improvements & Architecture Hardening)

**Date:** February 4, 2026

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Audience:** External + internal stakeholders

**Scope:** UX improvements, architecture compliance, and bug fixes

**Role legend:**

- Career Builder (role: `client`)
- Talent (role: `talent`)
- Admin (role: `admin`)

---

## Highlights

- **Avatar display on applications page**: Career Builders can now see talent avatars when reviewing applications, improving visual identification and UX
- **Architecture compliance**: Client applications page now follows server/client separation pattern with all data fetching on the server
- **Reset password page fix**: Fixed white-on-white text contrast issue making the reset password page fully readable
- **Storage URL utility**: New reusable utility for converting Supabase storage paths to public URLs, enabling consistent avatar/image handling across the platform
- **Reduced log noise**: Gated Supabase server debug logs behind environment flag to reduce production log noise

---

## By Role Surface

### Career Builder

- **Applications page improvements**: 
  - Talent avatars now display in applications list for better visual identification
  - Improved page performance with server-side data fetching
  - Better search and filter reliability

### Talent

- **No direct changes** (improvements are backend/architecture focused)

### Admin

- **No direct changes** (improvements are backend/architecture focused)

---

## Platform & Trust

- **Architecture compliance**: Client applications page now follows strict server/client separation (no Supabase reads in client components)
- **Performance**: Server-side data fetching reduces client-side load and improves initial page render
- **Code quality**: Explicit column selects maintained (no `select('*')` usage)
- **Observability**: Debug logging now gated behind `DEBUG_SUPABASE` environment variable to reduce production noise

---

## Bug Fixes

- **Reset password page**: Fixed white text on white background issue - heading and form labels now have proper contrast (`text-gray-900`)
- **Client applications**: Fixed architecture violation where client component was performing Supabase reads directly

---

## Technical Improvements

- **New utility**: `lib/utils/storage-urls.ts` - `publicBucketUrl()` function for consistent storage path to URL conversion
- **Server component pattern**: All data fetching moved to server `page.tsx` components, client components receive data via props
- **Logging improvements**: Supabase server debug logs only run when `DEBUG_SUPABASE=1` is set

---

## Known Limitations / In Progress

- Performance polish is ongoing (loading states, responsiveness, and speed improvements)
- Automated test coverage is expanding across core journeys
- Launch-prep tasks remain in progress (final security audit, analytics documentation, beta feedback)

---

## Schema/Type Changes

**No schema/type changes.**

All changes are code-level improvements and bug fixes. No database migrations or type definition changes required.

---

## Migration Notes

**No migration required.** This is a drop-in update with no breaking changes.
