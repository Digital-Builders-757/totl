## Schema/Type Changes

**No schema/type changes explicitly mentioned in release notes.**

Note: The platform uses a complete database schema with 13 tables (8 core + 5 supporting), comprehensive RLS policies, and full TypeScript type coverage. All database migrations are tracked in `supabase/migrations/` directory. The release notes focus on user-facing features rather than technical implementation details.
