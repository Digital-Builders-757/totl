## What's New

### Better Applications Experience for Career Builders

When reviewing talent applications, you'll now see **talent avatars** next to each application. This makes it easier to visually identify and remember applicants as you review them.

### Reset Password Page Fixed

The reset password page had a contrast issue where text was hard to read. This is now fixed - all text is clearly visible.

## What We Fixed

- **Applications page**: Now shows talent profile pictures (avatars) for better visual identification
- **Reset password page**: Text is now readable (was white on white before)
- **Performance**: Applications page loads faster and more reliably
