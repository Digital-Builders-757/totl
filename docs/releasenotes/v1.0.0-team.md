## 🎉 We're Live!

TOTL Agency MVP is officially live (Jan 25, 2026). 🎉

This is our first production-ready release of the platform that connects Talent (models/actors/creators) with Career Builders (brands/casting/clients) so they can post gigs, apply, review, and book — all in one place.

## What the App Does (Simple)

- **Career Builders** post gigs and review applicants
- **Talent** builds a profile + portfolio, browses gigs, and applies
- When a **Career Builder** accepts someone, it becomes a booking
- **Admins** can oversee users, gigs, applications, and moderation

## How to Use It (Quick Start)

### Talent
1. Sign up → complete profile + upload portfolio
2. Browse gigs → apply
3. Track status + bookings

### Career Builder
1. Sign up → complete company profile
2. Post a gig → review applications
3. Accept talent → manage bookings

### Admin
