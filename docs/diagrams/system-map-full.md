# Full System Map (Archive / Deep Reference)

**File:** `docs/diagrams/system-map-full.png`  
**Purpose:** A comprehensive system map used for **deep debugging and audits**, not everyday feature planning.

## When to use
- Tracing a bug across multiple modules
- Doing a system-wide refactor plan
- Investigating unexpected cross-module effects

## When NOT to use
- Day-to-day feature planning (too dense; increases confusion)
- As mandatory pre-read (will slow agents down and cause overreach)

## Notes
This diagram is kept as a reference artifact only.
