# Simplified Talent Account Creation Process

## Overview

The talent account creation process has been simplified to improve user experience and increase conversion rates. Instead of requiring users to fill out a lengthy form with personal and professional details during signup, we now collect only essential information initially and allow users to complete their profiles after registration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Signup Form

The initial signup form now collects only essential information:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email Address
- Password
- Terms Agreement
- Marketing Preferences (optional)

This streamlined approach reduces friction in the registration process while still gathering the necessary information to create an account.

### 2. Profile Completion in Dashboard

After registration and email verification, users are directed to complete their profiles in the talent dashboard. The profile completion process is divided into two sections:

#### Personal Information
- Phone Number
- Age
- Location
- Height (optional)
- Measurements (optional)
- Hair Color (optional)
- Eye Color (optional)
- Shoe Size (optional)
- Languages (optional)
- Instagram Handle (optional)

#### Professional Information
- Modeling Experience
- Portfolio Link (optional)
- Specialties (optional)
- Achievements (optional)
- Availability (optional)

### 3. Profile Completion Indicators

The talent dashboard now includes:
- A profile completion alert for incomplete profiles
- A direct link to the profile completion page
- Visual indicators of required fields

## Form Validation

### Signup Form Validation
- First Name: Required

## Backend Integration
