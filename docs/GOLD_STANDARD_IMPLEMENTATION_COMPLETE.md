# Gold Standard Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Production-ready enforcement system implemented

---

## Summary

Implemented the **gold standard** version of build rules enforcement system, matching production-grade specifications exactly.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Master Documentation (`docs/MASTER_BUILD_AND_DEPLOYMENT_RULES.md`)

**Added:** Explicit enforced invariants section with:
- **Why:** Reason each rule exists
- **How we detect violations:** Automated check that catches it
- **Fix pattern:** How to resolve violations

**Invariants codified:**
1. Client Boundary - Browser client only in `"use client"` files
2. Server Boundary - All DB writes via Server Actions
3. Query Discipline - No `select('*')`, `.single()` only when guaranteed
4. Env Discipline - Vercel env vars set per environment

### 2. Audit Scripts (Gold Standard)

**`scripts/audit-client-boundaries.mjs`**
- Uses Node.js ESM (`node:fs`, `node:path`)
- Handles formatting differences (regex for `"use client"`)
- Excludes scripts directory
- Hardline rule: browser imports require `"use client"`

**`scripts/audit-single-vs-maybe-single.mjs`**
- "Dumb but effective" - flags all `.single()` for human review
- Currently warns (not fails) - can be made to fail in CI once clean
- Simple pattern matching

**`scripts/audit-all.mjs`**
- Uses `spawnSync` for synchronous execution
- Runs all audits sequentially
- Exits with code 1 if any fail

**`scripts/quick-sanity-grep.ps1`**
- PowerShell script for Windows-first workflow
- Quick grep for common violations
- Simple pattern matching

### 3. Sentry Scrubbing (Gold Standard Pattern)

**Enhanced all 3 configs:**
- `sentry.server.config.ts`
- `sentry.edge.config.ts`
- `instrumentation-client.ts`

**Scrubbing pattern matches gold standard:**
```ts
const SENSITIVE_KEYS = ["authorization", "cookie", "set-cookie", "apikey", "token", "secret", "password"];

const scrub = (obj: unknown): unknown => {
  // Recursive scrubbing function
};

// Scrubs:
- event.request.headers
- event.request.data (large payloads >10KB)
- event.extra
- event.contexts
- event.user
```

### 4. NPM Scripts

**Added to `package.json`:**
```json
{
  "audit:client-boundaries": "node scripts/audit-client-boundaries.mjs",
  "audit:single-vs-maybe-single": "node scripts/audit-single-vs-maybe-single.mjs",
  "audit:all": "node scripts/audit-all.mjs",
  "audit:quick": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/quick-sanity-grep.ps1",
  "pre-push:check": "npm run schema:verify:comprehensive && npm run types:check && npm run build && npm run lint && npm run audit:all"
}
```

---

## ✅ Verification Results

### Client Boundary Audit
```
✅ audit-client-boundaries: no violations found
```

### Single vs MaybeSingle Audit
```
⚠️ .single() usages found (review required)
[Lists all .single() calls for human review]
```

**Note:** Currently warns (doesn't fail). Can be made to fail in CI once codebase is clean.

### All Audits
```
✅ Both audits run successfully
✅ Exit codes work correctly
```

## 📋 Files Changed

### Created
- `scripts/audit-client-boundaries.mjs` (gold standard version)
- `scripts/audit-single-vs-maybe-single.mjs` (gold standard version)
- `scripts/audit-all.mjs` (simplified with spawnSync)
- `scripts/quick-sanity-grep.ps1` (gold standard version)
- `docs/GOLD_STANDARD_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` (this file)

### Updated
- `docs/MASTER_BUILD_AND_DEPLOYMENT_RULES.md` (added enforced invariants section)
- `sentry.server.config.ts` (gold standard scrubbing pattern)
- `sentry.edge.config.ts` (gold standard scrubbing pattern)
- `instrumentation-client.ts` (gold standard scrubbing pattern)
- `package.json` (added audit scripts)

---

## 🎯 Usage

### Before Pushing Any Branch
```bash
npm run pre-push:check
```

### Quick Sanity Check
```bash
npm run audit:quick
```

### Individual Audits
```bash
npm run audit:client-boundaries
npm run audit:single-vs-maybe-single
npm run audit:all
```

---

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **CI Enforcement:** Add GitHub Actions workflow to run `npm run pre-push:check` on PRs
2. **Make .single() audit fail in CI:** Once codebase is clean, change audit to `process.exit(1)` on violations
3. **Documentation:** Add to team onboarding docs

---

## ✅ Gold Standard Compliance

- ✅ Master doc includes "why" + "how we detect" + "fix pattern"
- ✅ Audit scripts use Node.js ESM (`node:fs`, `node:path`)
- ✅ Client boundary audit handles formatting differences
- ✅ Sentry scrubbing matches gold standard pattern exactly
- ✅ NPM scripts match specification
- ✅ All scripts tested and working

**Implementation Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Production Ready:** ✅ Yes
