# Sentry Homepage & Navigation Errors Fix - October 23, 2025

**Issue Type:** Homepage Rendering Errors  
**Severity:** High (Blocking homepage)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Date Fixed:** October 23, 2025

---

## üö® Issues Fixed

### Error 1: "Cannot access 'isHomepage' before initialization"
**Sentry Issues:** JAVASCRIPT-NEXTJS-18, 16, 17  
**Location:** `components/navbar.tsx:63`  
**Impact:** Navbar failing to render, blocking all pages

**Root Cause:**
The `isHomepage` variable was declared in the wrong position, potentially after it was needed by React's rendering cycle, causing a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) error.

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Moved `isHomepage` declaration **immediately after hooks**
- ‚úÖ Added null safety: `pathname === "/" || pathname === null`
- ‚úÖ Ensured it's available before any usage

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE - Late initialization
useEffect(...);
useEffect(...);
handleSignOut = async () => { ... };

// Line 63 - Too late!
const isHomepage = pathname === "/";

// ‚úÖ AFTER - Early initialization with null safety
const pathname = usePathname();
const { user, userRole, signOut } = useAuth();

// Right after hooks - safe for SSR
const isHomepage = pathname === "/" || pathname === null;
```

### Error 2: "React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child"
**Sentry Issue:** JAVASCRIPT-NEXTJS-11  
**Location:** `app/talent/dashboard/page.tsx:410-413`  
**Impact:** Settings button failing to render on talent dashboard

**Root Cause:**
Button with `asChild` prop had a Link child containing multiple children (icon + text), but `asChild` requires exactly ONE React element child.

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Added flex container wrapper to Link element
- ‚úÖ Ensures Link renders as a single element

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE - Multiple children without wrapper
<Button asChild>
  <Link href="/settings">
    <Settings className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />  {/* Child 1 */}
    Settings                                 {/* Child 2 */}
  </Link>
</Button>

// ‚úÖ AFTER - Single child with flex wrapper
<Button asChild>
  <Link href="/settings" className="flex items-center">
    <Settings className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
    Settings
  </Link>
</Button>
```

## üìã Prevention Checklist

### For Variable Initialization Errors:
- [ ] Declare variables **immediately after hooks**
- [ ] Don't declare variables in the middle of functions
- [ ] Add null safety for pathname: `pathname === "/" || pathname === null`
- [ ] Test in both development and production modes

### For asChild Prop Errors:
- [ ] When using `asChild`, ensure child element has exactly ONE React child
- [ ] Wrap multiple children in a container: `<div>` or add `className="flex items-center"`
- [ ] Test all interactive elements after changes

### For Cache Issues:
- [ ] Clear `.next` folder when seeing "module not found" errors
- [ ] Restart dev server after major component deletions
- [ ] Use `npm run dev -- --turbo` for faster rebuilds
