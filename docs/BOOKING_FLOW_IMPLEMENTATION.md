# Booking Flow Implementation

## Overview
Complete implementation of the booking flow feature for TOTL Agency, allowing clients to review applications, accept/reject talent, and manage bookings.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Server Actions (`lib/actions/booking-actions.ts`)
- ✅ **acceptApplication**: Accept application and create booking with date, compensation, and notes
- ✅ **rejectApplication**: Reject application with optional reason
- ✅ **updateApplicationStatus**: Update application status in review workflow
- ✅ **getClientBookings**: Fetch all bookings for a client
- ✅ **updateBookingStatus**: Update booking status (pending → confirmed → completed)
- ✅ **cancelBooking**: Cancel a booking with optional reason

### 2. Dialog Components
- ✅ **AcceptApplicationDialog** (`components/client/accept-application-dialog.tsx`)
  - Form to enter booking date, compensation, and notes
  - Validates and creates booking
  - Auto-updates application status to "accepted"
  
- ✅ **RejectApplicationDialog** (`components/client/reject-application-dialog.tsx`)
  - Form to optionally provide rejection reason
  - Updates application status to "rejected"
  - Warning message for irreversible action

### 3. Enhanced Applications Page (`app/client/applications/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated with Accept/Reject buttons
- ✅ Integrated with new dialog components
- ✅ Real-time refresh after actions
- ✅ Status-based button visibility
- ✅ Clean UI with modern design

### 4. Bookings Management Page (`app/client/bookings/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Complete bookings dashboard
- ✅ Stats overview (Total, Pending, Confirmed, Completed, Cancelled)
- ✅ Tabbed interface for filtering by status
- ✅ Booking cards with talent info and gig details
- ✅ Action buttons based on booking status:
  - Pending → Confirm or Cancel
  - Confirmed → Mark Complete or Cancel
  - Completed/Cancelled → View only
- ✅ View talent profile link
- ✅ Display compensation and notes

## Database Schema Used

### `applications` table
- `id` (uuid)
- `gig_id` (uuid) - FK to gigs
- `talent_id` (uuid) - FK to profiles
- `status` (application_status enum: new, under_review, shortlisted, rejected, accepted)
- `message` (text)
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

### `bookings` table
- `id` (uuid)
- `gig_id` (uuid) - FK to gigs
- `talent_id` (uuid) - FK to profiles
- `status` (booking_status enum: pending, confirmed, completed, cancelled)
- `date` (timestamp)
- `compensation` (numeric)
- `notes` (text)
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

## Security Features
- ✅ Authentication required for all actions
- ✅ Authorization checks (client must own the gig)
- ✅ RLS policies enforced
- ✅ Prevents duplicate bookings
- ✅ Status validation

## User Flow

### Client accepts an application:
1. Navigate to `/client/applications`
2. Click "Accept" button on an application
3. Dialog opens with form fields:
   - Booking Date (optional, defaults to 7 days from now)
   - Compensation (optional, pre-filled from gig)
   - Notes (optional)
4. Click "Accept & Create Booking"
5. Booking created in "confirmed" status
6. Application status updated to "accepted"
7. Page refreshes to show updated status

### Client manages bookings:
1. Navigate to `/client/bookings`
2. View all bookings with filtering tabs
3. Take actions based on status:
   - **Pending**: Confirm or Cancel
   - **Confirmed**: Mark Complete or Cancel
4. View talent profiles
5. See compensation and notes

## API Routes
- ✅ Existing: `/api/client/applications/accept` (updated to use new schema)
- ✅ New actions use server actions (no API routes needed)

## Testing Checklist
