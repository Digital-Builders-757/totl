# Build and Audit Reference (Archived Root Copy)

This file was moved from the repository root during documentation hygiene cleanup.

## Why archived

The original root document duplicated canonical guidance that is already maintained in:

- `docs/development/MASTER_BUILD_AND_DEPLOYMENT_RULES.md`
- `docs/development/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_BUILD_RULES.md`
- `docs/development/ENGINEERING_COMMANDS.md`
- `docs/troubleshooting/COMMON_ERRORS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

## Current source of truth

Use the files above for active operational guidance.  
Keep this archive entry as a migration breadcrumb for historical references from older docs/notes.
