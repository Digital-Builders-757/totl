## üéØ Admin System Overview

The TOTL Agency platform has three user roles:
- **Talent** - Models, actors, performers
- **Client** - Companies, casting directors, agencies
- **Admin** - Platform administrators (you!)

### Admin Capabilities:
‚úÖ View all gigs (including drafts)  
‚úÖ View all applications  
‚úÖ View all users (talent and clients)  
‚úÖ Create new users with any role  
‚úÖ Manage platform content  
‚úÖ Access diagnostic tools  
‚úÖ Full platform oversight

## üóÑÔ∏è Understanding Dashboard "Cache"

### What You're Seeing

When you look at the database types (`types/database.ts`), you'll see several "views":

```typescript
Views: {
  admin_bookings_dashboard: { ... }
  admin_dashboard_cache: { ... }      // ‚Üê This one!
  admin_talent_dashboard: { ... }
}
```

### What Are These?

These are **PostgreSQL database views** - NOT traditional caches. Think of them as "saved queries" or "virtual tables."

#### **`admin_talent_dashboard`** (USED ‚úÖ)
- **Location:** Created in `supabase/migrations/20250813193749_admin_talent_dashboard_view.sql`
- **Purpose:** Pre-joins applications + gigs + profiles data
- **Used in:** `/admin/talentdashboard` and `/admin/talent-dashboard`
- **SQL:**
  ```sql
  SELECT 
    a.id as application_id,
    a.talent_id,
    a.status as application_status,
    g.title as gig_title,
    p.display_name as talent_display_name,
    cp.company_name as client_company_name
  FROM applications a
  JOIN gigs g ON g.id = a.gig_id
  JOIN profiles p ON p.id = a.talent_id
  LEFT JOIN client_profiles cp ON cp.user_id = g.client_id
  ```

#### **`admin_bookings_dashboard`** (USED ‚úÖ)
- **Purpose:** Pre-joins bookings + gigs + profiles data
- **Used in:** Admin booking views
- **Similar structure to talent dashboard view**

#### **`admin_dashboard_cache`** (NOT USED ‚ùå)
- **Status:** Appears in types but **NOT created in any migration**
- **Why:** Likely an artifact or planned feature that wasn't implemented
- **Action:** Can be safely ignored or removed from types

### How Views Work

When you query a view, PostgreSQL runs the underlying JOIN query in real-time:

```typescript
// You write:
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('admin_talent_dashboard')
  .select('*');

// PostgreSQL executes:
// SELECT ... FROM applications 
// JOIN gigs ... 
// JOIN profiles ...
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Simplifies complex queries
- ‚úÖ Consistent data structure
- ‚úÖ Type-safe in TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Easier to maintain

**Not a Cache:**
- ‚ùå Data is NOT stored/cached
- ‚ùå No performance improvement from caching
- ‚ùå Real-time data (always fresh)

## üîë Creating Your First Admin Account

### Method 1: Update Existing User (EASIEST)

If you already have an account on the platform, upgrade it to admin:

**Step 1:** Go to your Supabase Dashboard  
**Step 2:** Navigate to **SQL Editor**  
**Step 3:** Run this query (replace email with yours):

```sql
-- Find your user ID
SELECT id, email, role 
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Update your role to admin
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET role = 'admin', 
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users 
  WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com'
);

-- Verify the change
SELECT p.id, u.email, p.role, p.display_name
FROM public.profiles p
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = p.id
WHERE u.email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

**Step 4:** Log out and log back in  
**Step 5:** You should now see admin options!

---

### Method 2: Create New Admin User via Supabase Dashboard

**Step 1:** Go to Supabase Dashboard  
**Step 2:** Navigate to **Authentication > Users**  
**Step 3:** Click **"Add User"** or **"Invite User"**  
**Step 4:** Fill in the form:
- Email: `admin@yourcompany.com`
- Password: `your-secure-password`
- **‚úÖ Check "Auto-confirm user"** (skips email verification)

**Step 5:** After creation, go to **SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET role = 'admin', 
    display_name = 'Admin User',
    email_verified = true
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@yourcompany.com');
```

**Step 6:** Log in at `/login` with the new credentials

---

### Method 3: Use Admin UI (Requires Existing Admin)

If you already have one admin account:

**Step 1:** Log in as admin  
**Step 2:** Navigate to `/admin/users/create`  
**Step 3:** Fill in the form:
- Email
- Password  
- First Name
- Last Name
- **Role: Select "Admin"**

**Step 4:** Click "Create User"

---

### Method 4: Use Helper Script

We've created a PowerShell script to guide you:

```powershell
# From project root:
.\scripts\create-first-admin.ps1
```

The script will:
- Prompt for admin details
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Show SQL commands to run

## üéõÔ∏è Admin Dashboard Features

Once you're logged in as admin, you have access to:

### **Main Dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard`)
- Overview statistics (active gigs, applications, revenue)
- Recent gigs table with search/filter
- Quick actions (create gig, view applications)
- Stats cards showing:
  - Active Gigs count
  - Approved Applications count
  - Pending Applications count
  - Total Revenue (placeholder)

### **Gigs Management** (`/admin/gigs/create`)
- Create new gigs
- Edit existing gigs
- View all gigs (including drafts)
- Delete gigs

### **Applications** (`/admin/applications`)
- View all applications across all gigs
- Filter by status
- Review talent applications
- Accept/reject applications

### **Talent Dashboard View** (`/admin/talent-dashboard`)
- See platform from talent perspective
- View all talent profiles
- Browse applications as if you were talent
- Quality assurance tool

### **User Management** (`/admin/users/create`)
- Create new users (talent, client, or admin)
- Set roles directly
- Skip email verification
- Bulk user creation (future feature)

### **Diagnostic Tools** (`/admin/diagnostic`)
- System health checks
- Database connection tests

## üîê Admin Permissions

### What Admins Can Access

**Database Tables:**
- ‚úÖ Full read access to all tables
- ‚úÖ Can create gigs for any client
- ‚úÖ Can view all applications
- ‚úÖ Can view all user profiles
- ‚úÖ Can create users with service role (via API)

**Routes:**
- ‚úÖ `/admin/*` - All admin routes
- ‚úÖ `/talent/*` - Can view talent routes
- ‚úÖ `/client/*` - Can view client routes
- ‚úÖ All public routes

**RLS Policies:**
Admin role is checked in the middleware, not RLS policies. This means:
- Admins bypass most RLS restrictions through the app layer
- Database queries still use RLS, but middleware allows access
- Service role key used for admin-specific operations

### What Admins Cannot Do (By Design)

- ‚ùå Cannot delete users from UI (must use SQL)
- ‚ùå Cannot modify Supabase auth directly from UI
- ‚ùå Cannot access service role key from client
- ‚ùå Cannot bypass middleware protection

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "You don't have permission to access this page"

**Cause:** Your account doesn't have admin role  
**Solution:**
1. Check your role in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT email, role FROM profiles 
   JOIN auth.users ON profiles.id = auth.users.id 
   WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```
2. If role is not 'admin', update it:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' 
   WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com');
   ```
3. Log out and log back in

---

### Issue: "Admin dashboard is empty"

**Cause:** No data in database  
**Solution:** This is normal for a fresh installation. Create some gigs and applications to see data.

---

### Issue: "Cannot create users from admin panel"

**Cause:** API endpoint or Edge function not deployed  
**Solution:**
1. Check if endpoint exists: `/app/api/admin/create-user/route.ts`
2. Ensure Supabase Edge function is deployed
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set in environment

---

### Issue: "Role changes not taking effect"

**Cause:** Cached session  
**Solution:**
1. Log out completely
2. Clear browser cookies for the site
3. Log back in
4. Or force refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

## üéØ Quick Reference Commands

### Check User Role
```sql
SELECT u.email, p.role, p.display_name
FROM auth.users u
JOIN public.profiles p ON p.id = u.id
WHERE u.email = 'email@example.com';
```

### Make User Admin
```sql
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET role = 'admin'
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'email@example.com');
```

### List All Admins
```sql
SELECT u.email, p.display_name, p.created_at
FROM auth.users u
JOIN public.profiles p ON p.id = u.id
WHERE p.role = 'admin'
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

### Remove Admin Role (Demote to Talent)
```sql
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET role = 'talent'
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'email@example.com');
```
