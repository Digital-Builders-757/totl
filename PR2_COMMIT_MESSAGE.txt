fix(security): align middleware + route classification with Approach B + G1

Remove /gigs and /talent from public routes, eliminate public prefix allowlist,
and implement explicit one-segment public matchers only.

Changes:
- Route constants: removed /gigs and /talent from PUBLIC_ROUTES
- Route constants: removed PUBLIC_ROUTE_PREFIXES (too broad)
- Route constants: rewrote isPublicPath() to explicitly allow only:
  - /talent/[slug] (exactly one segment, not protected routes)
  - /gigs/[id] (exactly one segment)
- Middleware: hard deny /talent directory (redirect SO/T/C away)
- Middleware: require sign-in for /gigs list (redirect SO to login)
- Middleware: preserve /gigs/[id] and /talent/[slug] as public
- Middleware: bootstrap-safe - allow /gigs for signed-in users without profile
- Route access: updated needsTalentAccess() to correctly identify public slug routes

Documentation:
- Created PR2 summary: docs/PR2_SUMMARY.md
- Updated implementation tracker: docs/APPROACH_B_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Updated common errors reference: docs/COMMON_ERRORS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

What didn't change:
- RLS policies (PR3)
- Page-level data fetching (PR3)
- Slug resolution query strategy (PR4)

Risk: Medium (red zone - middleware/routing)
RED ZONE INVOLVED: YES
