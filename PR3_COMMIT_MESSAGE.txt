fix(data): enforce relationship-bound sensitive field access (PR3 - Option B)

Implement data-level restrictions for Approach B + G1 policy without schema changes.

Changes:
- Gig detail: ensure status='active' filter for all users (signed-out and signed-in)
- Gig list: move getUser() to top, early return before DB query (performance + correctness)
- Talent profile: replace blanket client access with relationship-bound check
  - Created reusable helper: lib/utils/talent-access.ts (canClientSeeTalentSensitive)
  - Client can only see sensitive fields if relationship exists (applicant/booking)
  - Improved relationship check: explicit gigs.client_id query (no PostgREST inference)
  - Added RLS-aware phone fetch: treats null as "protected" not "missing"
- TalentProfileClient: fixed to respect server-side relationship determination
- Truth-surface fixes: removed links to /talent directory, conditional /gigs back link

Documentation:
- Created PR3 summary: docs/PR3_SUMMARY.md
- Updated implementation tracker: docs/APPROACH_B_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Updated common errors reference: docs/COMMON_ERRORS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

What didn't change:
- RLS policies (Option B - no migrations)
- Schema structure (no new columns/tables)
- Slug resolution query strategy (PR4 - still enumerates)

Risk: Low-Medium (Data layer changes, no schema changes)
RED ZONE INVOLVED: NO
