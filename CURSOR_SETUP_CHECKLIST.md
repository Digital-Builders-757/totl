## ✅ Current Status

### **1. Context Files - COMPLETE**
- ✅ `TOTL_PROJECT_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md` (19KB, 605 lines) - Complete project context
- ✅ `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (5.3KB, 195 lines) - Quick access guide
- ✅ `CURSOR_CONTEXT_RULE.md` (4.8KB, 145 lines) - Setup instructions

### **2. Cursor Rules - COMPLETE**
- ✅ `.cursorrules` (3.4KB, 89 lines) - Project-specific rules
- ✅ `.cursor/project-context.md` - Project context for Cursor
- ✅ `.cursor/global-context.md` - Global development standards

### **3. Cursor Context Features - SETUP REQUIRED**

---

## 🚀 Bulletproof Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Verify Cursor Context Files**

Your project now has these Cursor-specific files:

```
.cursor/
├── project-context.md      # Project-specific context
└── global-context.md       # Global development standards

.cursorrules               # Project rules (auto-applied)
TOTL_PROJECT_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md  # Complete project context
QUICK_REFERENCE.md         # Quick reference guide
```

### **Step 2: Cursor Settings Configuration**

1. **Open Cursor Settings** (`Ctrl/Cmd + ,`)
2. **Go to "AI" or "Assistant" section**
3. **Enable these features:**
   - ✅ **Project Context** - Should auto-load `.cursor/project-context.md`
   - ✅ **Global Context** - Should auto-load `.cursor/global-context.md`
   - ✅ **Custom Rules** - Should auto-load `.cursorrules`

### **Step 3: Test the Setup**

**Test Command:** Ask Cursor to "Create a new API route for user profile updates"

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Cursor should reference the project context
2. Use proper TypeScript types from `types/database.ts`
3. Follow the established patterns
4. Include proper error handling
5. Use the correct Supabase client

### **Step 4: Verify Context Loading**

**Check if Cursor is using your context:**

1. **Start a new chat** in Cursor
2. **Ask:** "What is the database schema for the TOTL Agency project?"
3. **Expected Response:** Should reference your context files and provide accurate schema information

## 🎯 Context Reference Pattern

When working with Cursor, you should see this pattern:

```markdown
## 🔍 CONTEXT CHECK COMPLETED

✅ Referenced: `TOTL_PROJECT_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md`
✅ Checked: Database schema in `supabase/migrations/`
✅ Verified: RLS policies for data access
✅ Using: Generated types from `types/database.ts`
✅ Following: Project architecture patterns

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If Context Isn't Loading:**

1. **Check Cursor Version**
   - Ensure you're using the latest version of Cursor
   - Some context features require recent updates

2. **Verify File Locations**
   - `.cursorrules` should be in project root
   - `.cursor/` folder should be in project root
   - All files should have proper Markdown formatting

3. **Restart Cursor**
   - Close and reopen Cursor
   - Sometimes context files need a restart to load

4. **Check Cursor Settings**
   - Go to Settings → AI
   - Ensure "Project Context" and "Custom Rules" are enabled

### **If Rules Aren't Being Followed:**

1. **Explicit Reference**
   - Start chats with: "Please reference the TOTL_PROJECT_CONTEXT_PROMPT.md file"
   - Ask: "What are the current database tables in this project?"

2. **Manual Context**
   - Copy relevant sections from context files
   - Paste at the beginning of chat sessions

3. **File-Specific Questions**
   - Ask about specific files: "What's in types/database.ts?"
   - Reference specific patterns: "How should I structure a new API route?"
