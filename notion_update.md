# TOTL Agency Progress Update

## 🧱 Overview

> What is Totl Agency?
> 
> 
> It's a web platform that helps **talent (like models or creatives)** get discovered and **book gigs** with **clients (like brands or casting agents)**. Think of it like *Backstage.com*, but cleaner, faster, and more tailored for today's user experience.
> 

---

## ✅ What's Done

> This is everything that's already built or fully functional.
> 

### 🔐 Authentication

- **Email/password login**: Users can sign up and log in securely.
- **Role-based signup**: Talent and clients get different account types and dashboards.
- **Email verification flow**: We've started adding a "click the link in your email to verify" feature for extra security.
- **✅ Admin Account Creation**: Successfully created and tested admin login (`admin@totl.test` / `TestAdmin123!`)

### 💻 Frontend

- **Next.js App Router**: Our frontend is built using a modern, scalable routing system from Next.js 15.
- **Tailwind + shadcn/ui**: All UI elements (buttons, forms, cards, etc.) use clean, responsive components.
- **Reusable Components**: Everything is modular—meaning easy to scale and maintain.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Works across mobile, tablet, and desktop, tailored per user type.

### 🛢️ Database (Supabase)

- **Core Tables**: We've created all the database tables for user profiles, gigs, applications, bookings, etc.
- **Enums**: Enums define valid values for roles and status (e.g. `gig_status = active`, `booking_status = confirmed`).
- **Triggers**: When someone signs up, we automatically create their profile and role data behind the scenes.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Keeps data safe—users can only see or modify their own stuff.
- **✅ MCP Integration**: Successfully integrated Supabase MCP server for automated database operations

### 🚀 DevOps

- **GitHub Setup**: Version control is live with protected branches (for code review).
- **Vercel Deployment**: App is hosted on Vercel with auto-preview links for every pull request.
- **Documentation**: There's a full README and coding style guide to keep things clean for all devs.

### 🎬 Gig Management

- **✅ Gig Creation System**: Fully functional admin gig creation form
- **✅ Gig Display**: All gigs display correctly on `/gigs` page
- **✅ Gig Details**: Individual gig pages load with complete information
- **✅ Test Data**: Created 3 test gigs including "ctrl alt play" and "Test Fashion Shoot"

## 🚧 What's In Progress

> These are the features we're actively working on.
> 

### 🔄 AuthProvider

- This handles session logic inside the app — lets us check "who is the user?" and "what role do they have?" consistently.

### 🔐 Middleware

- This protects routes (pages), so that clients and talent only access what they're allowed to.

### 🧑‍💻 Dashboards

- We're linking talent and client dashboards to live data from Supabase (e.g. show posted gigs, show who applied, etc.)

### 📩 Application Flow

- **🟡 PARTIALLY WORKING**: Talent users can browse gigs, view details, and access application forms
- **❌ APPLICATION SUBMISSION**: 406 error when submitting applications (server action issue)

---

## ⏳ What's Left

> This is what's still needed to complete the MVP.
> 

### 🔧 Critical Fixes Needed

- **🚨 APPLICATION SUBMISSION BUG**: Fix 406 error in talent application form submission
- **🔧 SERVER ACTION CONFIGURATION**: Resolve server action issues preventing application saves

### 🔐 Email Verification & Password Reset

- Ensures users confirm their identity and can recover their accounts if they forget their password.

### 🧾 Profile Editing

- Lets users update their display name, bio, links, photos, etc.

### 🖼️ Image Uploads

- Enables uploading profile pictures or gig images using Supabase Storage.

### 🔍 Gig Filtering/Search

- Allows users to filter gigs by location, category, etc. Think job board search bar.

### 📆 Booking Flow

- After reviewing applications, clients can "book" someone, setting time, location, etc.

### 🧪 Testing

- **Unit tests**: Check that the code works in small pieces.
- **E2E tests (Cypress)**: Simulate full user flows (signing up, applying to a gig, etc.)

### 🚀 Final Staging & Launch

- We'll push to a live staging environment, test everything, and then launch to the public.

---

## 🔧 Current Technical Status

### ✅ **Successfully Fixed Issues:**
1. **Server-side application errors** - Fixed "nextCookies.get is not a function" error
2. **Gig detail page loading** - No more crashes when viewing gig pages
3. **Authentication flow** - Talent users can log in and access protected pages
4. **Gig browsing** - Users can view all gigs and click "Apply Now"
5. **Application form display** - Forms load correctly with all fields

### ❌ **Current Blocking Issue:**
- **Application submission fails** with 406 error
- **Server action configuration** needs debugging
- **Form submission** doesn't save to database

### 🎯 **Test Credentials:**
- **Admin**: `admin@totl.test` / `TestAdmin123!`
- **Talent**: `bboylion@gmail.com` / `Aiight123!`

## **🔧 Additional Recommendations:**

### **For Future Talent Onboarding:**

1. **Force profile completion** after signup
2. **Add validation** to prevent empty talent_profiles
3. **Show profile completion progress** to talent users

### **For Client Experience:**

1. **Add profile completion prompts** for talent
2. **Show "Profile Incomplete" badges** for talent with empty profiles
3. **Implement contact functionality** for the Review/Contact buttons

### **For Admin Experience:**

1. **✅ Admin dashboard** is fully functional
2. **✅ Gig creation** works perfectly
3. **✅ Application viewing** ready (pending application submissions)

---

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

**The talent application submission is the ONLY remaining blocker for basic functionality.**

**Test Steps:**
1. ✅ Login as talent (`bboylion@gmail.com` / `Aiight123!`)
2. ✅ Browse to `/gigs`
3. ✅ Click on any gig
4. ✅ Click "Apply Now"
5. ✅ Fill out cover letter
6. ❌ **Submit fails with 406 error**

**Once this is fixed, the core MVP functionality will be complete!** 🎉
