# 🎯 STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT ANALYSIS

## 🚀 TOTL STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT - CTO-GRADE SYSTEM DESIGN

### **Executive Summary**
**Goal**: Transform TOTL from solid MVP into robust, sellable marketplace without fighting the stack.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Database as Product Backbone** - Keep logic at data layer (RLS, RPC, materialized views, triggers)
2. **Stabilize Money & Messaging** - Bulletproof booking/contract/payment pipeline + durable messaging
3. **Codify Cache & Consistency** - Tag-based revalidation, per-user caches, materialized views
4. **Own Observability & Cost** - SLOs, alerts, slow-query budgets, storage controls
5. **Make Future Plans Cheap** - Organizations/seats, event schema, feature flags

### **Target Architecture**
```
