## 📝 CTO Equity Agreement - Separate Arrangement

**Note:** The CTO Equity Agreement (2% equity, fully vested) is a **separate arrangement** and does not replace or offset the SDA payment obligations.

**Key Points:**
- Equity grant is separate from SDA payment terms
- Completion condition: "once the company is fully able to pay a monthly salary of approximately $1,000/monthly"
- Does not affect the $9,000 outstanding payment for completed SDA work
- CTO equity is appreciated but does not replace payment for work already completed

## ✅ Production Ready

The platform is **100% production-ready** with:
- ✅ All original deliverables complete
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security
- ✅ Performance optimized

3. **Future Work:** Any additional features require new agreement and payment
4. **CTO Role:** Equity agreement is separate; future CTO work subject to separate budget allocation ($3,000/month per CTO agreement)

---

- **SDA Work:** 100% complete, $9,000 payment outstanding
- **Additional Value:** $22,000+ in features beyond scope
