1. **Ensure dev server is running:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser to:** `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Open Browser DevTools:** (F12 or Right-click → Inspect)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Clear any existing logs

---

### Test 6: Interactive Elements ✅

- [ ] Should show 404 or redirect
- [ ] Page doesn't crash
- [ ] **Check Console:** Error is handled gracefully

---

### Test 8: Development HMR (Optional) ✅
**Tests webpack error filtering**

- [ ] Save the file
- [ ] Page hot-reloads
- [ ] **Check Sentry Dashboard:** No "Cannot read properties" errors logged
