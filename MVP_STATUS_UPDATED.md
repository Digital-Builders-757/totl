# totl MVP - Updated Status

🧱 Overview

---

> What is Totl Agency?
> 
> 
> It's a web platform that helps **talent (like models or creatives)** get discovered and **book gigs** with **clients (like brands or casting agents)**. Think of it like [*Backstage.com*](http://backstage.com/), but cleaner, faster, and more tailored for today's user experience.
