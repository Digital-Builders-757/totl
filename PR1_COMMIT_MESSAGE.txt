fix(ui): align discoverability surfaces with Approach B + G1 policy

Remove all UI surfaces that advertise "Browse Talent Directory" or "Browse Gigs" 
for signed-out users, aligning with locked policy matrix (Approach B + G1).

Date: December 21, 2025

Changes:
- Navbar: removed "Talent" directory link; "Gigs" only for signed-in users
- Homepage: removed "Browse Talent" CTAs (hero + footer); removed "Find Gigs" footer link
- Command palette: changed "Browse Gigs" to "Sign in to Browse Gigs" for signed-out
- Admin labels: renamed "View Talent Portal" → "Public Site View"
- Demo pages: removed links to restricted areas

Documentation:
- Created canonical policy matrix: docs/POLICY_MATRIX_APPROACH_B.md
- Created implementation tracker: docs/APPROACH_B_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Created PR1 summary: docs/PR1_SUMMARY.md

What didn't change:
- Middleware routing logic (PR2)
- Route allowlists (PR2)
- RLS policies (PR3)
- Database queries (PR4)

Risk: Low (UI-only changes, no red zone)
RED ZONE INVOLVED: NO
